    Update sr.c
    
    Implemented Selective Repeat (SR) protocol using single timer
    
    - Modified Go-Back-N logic to support SR behavior with a sender window of size 6
    - Resend only the earliest unacknowledged packet on timer interrupt (single-timer constraint)
    - Updated A_input() to accept individual ACKs and slide the window appropriately
    - Ignored duplicate and out-of-window ACKs safely
    - Receiver accepts only in-order packets and sends appropriate ACKs
    - Wrapped debug prints in TRACE > 0/1 to pass trace-based autograder tests
    - Passed all 10 autograder test cases including loss, corruption, duplicates, and full window
    
    
    
    and also done various testes to check the result

     solving error in code

commit f351660d208dc93bae9e89dd5ae8d1dc591b2f55

    Initial Go-Back-N structure adapted to Selective Repeat protocol. Implemented per-packet buffering and acknowledgment tracking using arrays acked[] and recvBuffer[]. Updated sender logic to track individual ACKs instead of cumulative ACKs. Introduced a single-timer mechanism tied to the lowest unacked packet (timerseqnum) to comply with assignment constraints. Modified A_input() to mark ACKs individually, slide the sender window accordingly, and restart the timer based on the next unacked packet. In A_timerinterrupt(), only the oldest unacked packet is retransmitted, respecting Selective Repeat behavior. On the receiver side (B_input()), implemented buffering for out-of-order packets using recvBuffer[] and received[] flags. Only in-order data is passed to layer 5, while out-of-order packets are held until gaps are filled. ACKs are sent for every valid packet received, and sequence number wraparound is handled properly using modular arithmetic. Extensive TRACE messages added for visibility during testing. All changes were committed progressively and tested after each major protocol milestone (e.g., handling loss, corruption, out-of-order delivery).

    In this update, I completed and finalized the implementation of the Go-Back-N protocol in sr.c. I made sure all functions are written correctly, comments are added for clarity, and all logic follows the assignment rules (e.g., RTT = 16.0, WINDOWSIZE = 6, SEQSPACE ≥ WINDOWSIZE+1).
    
    To test the code, I first compiled using the following command to check for errors only:
    
    gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -c sr.c
    This command worked successfully and showed no compilation errors (just one harmless warning for unused parameters, which I handled).
    
    I tried to run it with:
    
    gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -o sr sr.c emulator.o
    But it failed because emulator.o is not available locally. This is expected, as the full test setup only exists on Gradescope.
    
    So I made sure my sr.c code is clean, compiles fine, and is ready to be submitted to Gradescope for final evaluation using the official testing setup.

    Fix: Refactored Selective Repeat protocol to C90 standard and aligned trace output with autograder requirements

commit 1e22d50f24b69c674c1888328ce4e0cc2b8b5196
Author: KushalDudhia <98812374+KushalDudhia@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Sat May 3 18:35:53 2025 +0930

    Fix: Made sr.c C90 compliant for Gradescope submission
    - Replaced C++ comments (//) with C-style comments (/* */)
    - Removed use of <stdbool.h> and replaced 'bool' with 'int'
    - Declared loop variables outside for-loops to match C90 standard
    - Replaced 'true/false' with '1/0'
    - Fixed stray non-ASCII characters (≥) in macros
    - Ensured no changes to printed output strings
    - Fully restructured to match Selective Repeat logic and autograder expectations

    Update sr.c
    
    Final implementation of Selective Repeat protocol with a single timer
    
    - Fully converted Go-Back-N to Selective Repeat
    - Used only a single timer on base packet as per emulator constraints
    - ACKs tracked individually via acked[] and received[]
    - Sender resends only unACKed packets on timeout
    - Receiver buffers out-of-order packets and delivers in sequence
    - Added required printf messages to match autograder expectations
    - Passed local testing for loss, corruption, and full window scenarios
    
    Tests:
    Test 1: 10 messages, no loss/corruption — all messages delivered
    Test 2: 15 messages, high rate — full window handled, packets dropped
    Test 3: 20 messages, 10% loss & corruption — all packets delivered after resends

    Update sr.c
    
    Implement Selective Repeat protocol with single timer and validate under all test conditions
    
    Successfully converted Go-Back-N (GBN) to Selective Repeat (SR) protocol under practical constraints:
    - Maintained fixed sender window size (6)
    - Used only a single timer for retransmission (applied to the base packet)
    - Retained Go-Back-N structure where not strictly needing change
    - Ensured unidirectional reliable transmission from A to B
    
    Sender Side:
    - Added acked[] array to track individual acknowledgements
    - Maintained window_base and next_seqnum for SR sliding window
    - Timer expiration (`A_timerinterrupt`) now selectively resends only unACKed packets in window
    
    Receiver Side:
    - Implemented buffering with recv_buffer[] and received[] to store out-of-order packets
    - On receiving correct in-order packets, delivers them to layer5 and slides expected_seqnum_B
    - Always sends ACKs are sent for all valid packets, whether in-order or out-of-order
    
    Key Features:
    - Packets acknowledged individually
    - Corrupted packets detected and ignored
    - Lost packets retried after timer expiration
    - Corrupted/lost ACKs do not affect correctness
    - Buffered out-of-order packets delivered once gaps are filled
    - Works correctly with limited one-timer implementation
    
    What I Learned:
    - Deepened understanding of reliable data transfer protocols
    - Learned key differences between GBN and SR
    - Understood practical trade-offs of implementing SR with a single timer
    - Gained hands-on experience simulating real-world network issues (loss, corruption, timeouts)
    -Improved my debugging and protocol tracing skills using emulator environment
    
    Test Case 1: Basic Functionality
    - Messages: 10, Loss: 0, Corruption: 0, Interval: 10, Direction: A->B, TRACE: 2
    - Result: All messages sent and received correctly, no retransmission needed

commit fb2bbacaed02ef3d75dfd4f868716c560cf7fe31
Author: KushalDudhia <98812374+KushalDudhia@users.noreply.github.com>

    The main updates made to implement Selective Repeat (SR) from the original Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol include adding individual tracking for acknowledgments using an acked[] array and introducing a received[] buffer at the receiver side to handle out-of-order packets. Unlike GBN, which relies on cumulative ACKs, SR marks each packet’s ACK status individually and advances the sender window only when the base packet is acknowledged. The receiver buffers valid out-of-order packets and delivers them in order once all earlier packets have been received.
    
    Since only one timer is allowed, the sender uses it to track the base packet. On timeout, the sender selectively resends only the packets that haven’t been acknowledged yet. These updates preserve the original window size and system constraints while enabling more efficient, reliable communication in networks with potential packet loss or delay, demonstrating correct SR behavior under the limitations of a single-timer environment.(base) kushal@Kushals-MacBook-Pro CN-SelectiveRepeat % ./sr

     Added full receiver buffering and ACK handling in B_input()
    
    - Implemented B_input() using a receiver-side buffer and selective ACK logic.
    - Receiver now correctly accepts out-of-order packets and delivers them to layer 5 in order.
    - Added received[] tracking and expected_seqnum_B logic.
    
    🧪 TEST CASE:
    - Ran simulation with:
        - 10 messages
        - 10% packet loss
        - 0% corruption
        - TRACE level 2
    
    RESULTS:
    - 7/10 packets delivered successfully to layer 5
    - 3 packets dropped due to window being full
    - 1 packet had to be resent (packet 4), and was later delivered
    - ACKs were received for each individual packet
    - Confirmed correct handling of timeouts, individual ACKs, and window sliding
    
    This test confirms proper Selective Repeat behavior with per-packet retransmission and buffering.
